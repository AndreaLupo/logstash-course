# The pipeline process access log from Apache web server. It does:
# - process data from file or http (on localhost:8080)
# - filter with grok andh the commonlog pattern to retrieve data
# - mutate some fields to the right data type
# - set the @timestamp of the event to the timetamp contained in the processed line, then remove the timestamp generated field
# - print the event to output and to file. The file has a name that contains the date of the current event processed.
# - manage error and access logs with different behaviours
